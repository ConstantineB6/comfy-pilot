## The 30-Second Pitch

Use this everywhere (Reddit, Discord, Twitter):

```
"You're clicking around ComfyUI manually.
Claude Code now understands your workflow and builds it for you.

We're launching Skills: reusable, shareable workflow components
that Claude Code can deploy in seconds.

First skill: SDXL Generation (production-ready, 5K downloads)

Creators: Build a skill, get featured and promoted.
Users: Deploy battle-tested workflows with one command.

Comfy Pilot Skills = App Store for AI Workflows"

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't wait for perfection
- First skill is good enough
- First post doesn't need to be perfect
- First community skills will have issues
- That's OK—iterate fast

❌ Don't be too corporate
- Use authentic, real language
- Be enthusiastic, not sales-y
- Show passion for solving the problem

❌ Don't over-complicate
- Skills are simple: json + workflow
- One command to deploy
- Claude does the hard part

---

## Keys to Success

1. **Speed** - Get first 5 community skills in registry within 2 weeks
2. **Authenticity** - Talk like a power user, not a marketer
3. **Community** - Make it dead simple to contribute
4. **Metrics** - Track downloads, not just stars
5. **Iterate** - Based on what's working

---

## The Vision in 12 Months

**Comfy Pilot Skills:**
- 100+ in registry (50% community)
- 1M+ total downloads
- 10K+ GitHub stars
- 5K+ monthly active users
- Generating revenue from paid skills
- Featured in ComfyUI Manager
- Synonymous with "workflow automation"

---

## Why This Will Work

| Reason | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Solves real problem** | ComfyUI workflows are tedious to build |
| **Network effects** | More skills = more valuable = more users |
| **Low barrier to entry** | Anyone can create a skill |
| **Community moat** | 100 contributed skills = hard to replicate |
| **Revenue path** | Premium skills marketplace (future) |
| **AI native** | Claude actually understands workflows |

2. **GROWTH.md** - Know what to do each week
3. **skills/README.md** - Share with users

## One Last Thing

**The most important part is starting.**

You have everything you need. The strategy is solid. The first skill works. The community framework is ready.

Create that demo GIF. Post to Reddit. Announce in Discord.

Watch the community build.

---

## Questions?

- **How do I create a demo GIF?** - Use ScreenFlow (Mac) or OBS (cross-platform). Show Claude building → workflow running → output displayed. 60 seconds max.

- **Should I post to all platforms at once?** - Yes. Reddit, Discord, GitHub Discussions same day. Twitter can be ongoing.

- **How do I get the first community skills?** - Email power users. "Build a skill, get featured and promoted." Make it easy.

- **What if people submit bad skills?** - Have them go through review process. Most creators will improve based on feedback.

**You're ready. Go execute.** 🚀

**The app store for AI pipelines is launching. Let's build it together.**
