# 10K Stars in 7 Days: Viral Blitz Strategy

**Target:** 10,000 GitHub stars by end of Week 1
**Current:** ~50 stars
**Required:** 200 stars/day average (achievable with coordinated blitz)

---

## The Core Insight

We don't need to be incrementally better. We need to be **so obviously different** that it spreads organically.

**Current narrative:** "MCP server for ComfyUI"
**Viral narrative:** "Claude Code just became a workflow co-pilot. Build entire pipelines at conversation speed."

---

## DAY 1: Foundation & Launch (Monday)

```

**Expected from PH:** 1,000-2,000 stars by end of day

### 11 AM: HackerNews Post (CRITICAL)
```
Title: "Comfy Pilot – Claude Code as your ComfyUI co-pilot"

Story:
"ComfyUI is powerful but slow (lots of clicking).
Claude Code is fast (conversation speed).

Comfy Pilot connects them.

Tell Claude what you want. Watch your workflow build in real-time.
It's not describing what to do—it's actually doing it.

MCP server gives Claude full access to your workflow graph.
Embedded terminal runs Claude Code right inside ComfyUI.

This is what AI-native workflow automation looks like."

Strategy:
- Post at 6 AM Pacific (optimal timing)

Title (r/ChatGPT): "Claude Code now controls ComfyUI. Here's what that means."

Body:
"You're building workflows in ComfyUI like it's 2019. Clicking nodes. Arranging boxes.

Claude Code just became your co-pilot.

Tell it: 'Generate an SDXL portrait workflow'
Claude builds the entire thing. Runs it. Shows output.

No UI navigation. No description. Just execution.

This is the shift from 'AI describes what to do' to 'AI does the thing.'

## TOTAL 7-DAY TARGET: 10,000+ Stars

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. **Product Perfection**
- Demo GIF must be crystal clear (3 seconds: ask → workflow builds → runs)
- README must load instantly
- No bugs in first 72 hours
- Skills system must work flawlessly

### 2. **Narrative Coherence**
Every post, every platform, same message:
> "Claude Code becomes your workflow co-pilot.
> Tell it what you want. It builds the workflow."

Not: "MCP server for ComfyUI"
Not: "Skills ecosystem"

**One story:** AI-native automation is here.

### 3. **Timing Perfection**
- ProductHunt: Monday 12:01 AM PST (first position critical)
- HackerNews: Monday 6 AM PST (morning traffic)
- Reddit: Monday 10 AM PST (peak activity)
- Twitter: Ongoing but peak at 8 AM PST daily

### 4. **Community Mobilization**
- Reach out to 100+ creators directly
- Get first 500 stars from warm network
- These seed the viral growth
- Every creator who shares = 100-500 additional stars

### 5. **Influencer Amplification**
Priority creators to contact:
1. RyanOnTheInside (real-time workflow innovator)
2. Sebastian Kamph (advanced tutorials, 50K+ audience)
3. Olivio Sarikas (educational reach, 100K+ total followers)
4. Purz (20K YouTube, interview format)
5. Dr. Lt. Data (ecosystem credibility)

Each share = 200-500 stars minimum.

### 6. **Response Speed**
- Team on standby for first 48 hours
- Answer every comment/question within 30 min
- Show genuine engagement, not sales
- Thank every person who shares

## Media Assets Needed

```
✅ Demo GIF (3 sec): Claude asks → Workflow builds → Runs
✅ Screenshot: Terminal inside ComfyUI
✅ Workflow comparison chart: Before/After
✅ 60-second YouTube video
✅ Technical architecture diagram
✅ Usage examples (portrait, landscape, batch)
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

### "This will die after a week"
- No. If we hit 10K stars, we have momentum for 20K
- Community skills prove staying power
- Media coverage extends virality
- Influencer network sustains growth

### "GitHub stars don't matter"
- They do for:
  - Visibility algorithm
  - Press credibility
  - Developer confidence
  - Ecosystem trust
  - Future funding/partnerships

### "The product isn't ready"
- It must be. 10K stars = 10K users testing
- Any bugs will be instantly reported
- We need 72 hours of flawless operation minimum

### "We can't coordinate this"
- Yes we can. It's 7 days of focused execution
- Team of 3-5 people max
- Everything is planned above
- Just follow the checklist

---

## Why This Works

### The Math
```
ProductHunt #1:     1,500 stars
HackerNews front:   1,000 stars
Reddit posts:       2,000 stars
Twitter amplification: 1,000 stars
Creator shares:     2,000 stars
Discord/communities:  500 stars
Organic/followers:  1,000 stars
-----------
Total:              9,000 stars
```

Plus overflow, weekend surge, etc. = 10K+

### The Narrative
This isn't "another tool"—it's a paradigm shift:
- From UI-based to AI-native
- From click-speed to conversation-speed
- From manual to automated
- From describing to doing

People share paradigm shifts.

### The Timing
- ComfyUI is hot (20K+ stars)
- Claude Code is new (users hungry for integrations)
- MCP protocol is being discovered (first good example)
- AI automation is zeitgeist
- **Perfect storm = viral moment**

## Post-10K Strategy (Week 2)

Once we hit 10K:
- Announce funding (if applicable)

- Launch skills marketplace MVP
- Announce partnerships
- Media interview tour

10K stars is the launchpad. Then we scale to 50K.

We're not betting that GitHub stars matter.
We're betting that **10K developers trying Comfy Pilot in one week** will create:
- Network effects
- Community skills
- Influencer credibility
- Press coverage
- Organic growth

And *that's* what builds a platform.
