## SHOOT CHECKLIST

### PART 1: PLANNING (2 hours)

- [ ] Scout location (home office/creative studio)
- [ ] Determine lighting setup (before: harsh screen light | after: warm natural light)
- [ ] Plan shot list (see detailed breakdown below)
- [ ] Prep screen recordings (ComfyUI + Claude terminal workflows)
- [ ] Backup footage (shoot everything 2-3 times)

### PART 2: SCREEN RECORDING (4 hours)

**You'll need to record these interactions:**

#### Before Workflow (showing tedium)
```
1. ComfyUI opening → blank canvas
2. Time-lapse of node placement (CheckpointLoader, CLIPTextEncode x2, KSampler, VAEDecode)
3. Clicking and dragging nodes into position
4. Setting parameters (steps, CFG, seed)
5. Connecting wires between nodes
6. Running workflow (single image)
7. Examining result
8. Adjusting a parameter
9. Running again
10. Time-lapse of multiple runs (UI is cluttered, many workflows visible)
```

**Screen recording specs:**
- Resolution: 1080p or 1440p (4K if possible)
- Frame rate: 60fps
- Audio: Capture keyboard clicks + system sounds
- Duration: Let each action breathe (don't compress too much)

#### After Workflow (showing automation)
```
1. Terminal (Claude Code) opening
2. User typing Claude prompt
3. Claude Code responding: "Building your workflow..."
4. Text streaming as Claude thinks
5. ComfyUI updating in background (nodes appearing)
6. Nodes auto-connecting (smooth animation)
7. Parameters being set
8. "Ready to run" message
9. Queue tone + execution starting
10. Time-lapse of 50 images generating
11. All outputs appearing in grid
12. User review/annotation
```

**Screen recording specs:**
- Resolution: 1080p or 1440p (4K if possible)
- Frame rate: 60fps
- Audio: Capture typing, system sounds, generation hum
- Keep Claude terminal clean and readable
- Make sure workflow visualization is clear

## BACKUP PLAN

If full production is impossible:
1. Use existing screen recordings only (no live action)
2. Create animated lower-thirds with before/after text
3. Use AI avatar or voiceover (Elevenlabs, Synthesia)
4. Reduces production time to 4-6 hours
5. Less emotional impact, but still effective

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The WORLD GIF succeeds if:
- [ ] Viewers feel the exhaustion in the "before" (visceral)
- [ ] The transformation at 15s is shocking (emotional impact)
- [ ] The "after" feels genuinely different (not just faster)
- [ ] Viewers want that world (aspirational)
- [ ] They share it (viral instinct triggered)
- [ ] No one questions the product—they question why they don't use it

**This is not a product demo. This is a recruitment film.**

You're recruiting people into a world, not explaining a tool.

Make it real. Make it felt. Make it transformative.
