## THINGS TO AVOID

❌ **Don't launch without WORLD GIF**
→ The GIF is the entire strategy. Without it, you're just another product launch.

❌ **Don't post corporate-sounding copy**
→ Use authentic, street-level language
→ Sound like creators, not marketers

❌ **Don't launch with bugs**
→ First 72 hours are critical
→ Any issues will be amplified

❌ **Don't miss timing windows**
→ ProductHunt: 12:01 AM PST (first position matters)
→ HackerNews: 6 AM PST (peak traffic)
→ Reddit: 10 AM PST (peak activity)

❌ **Don't ignore comments/questions**
→ 30-minute response time is critical
→ Shows engagement, not automation

❌ **Don't post the same copy everywhere**
→ Each platform has different audiences
→ Tailor the message (but keep WORLD narrative consistent)

## THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS MOST

**The WORLD GIF.**

If you only do one thing, do this:
1. Shoot the before/after split-screen
2. Edit it to show transformation
3. Put it everywhere

The GIF carries the entire narrative.
It shows (not tells) what Comfy Pilot creates.

Everything else is amplification.

- ✅ WORLD GIF storyboard (shot-by-shot)
- ✅ Marketing copy (all platforms, authentic)
- ✅ Production plan (timeline, technical specs)
- ✅ Launch strategy (day-by-day, metrics)
- ✅ This checklist (what to do and when)

The only variable now is **execution**.

This checklist ensures you execute flawlessly.

Use it. Finish each item. Move to launch.

**The world is waiting for you to build it.** 🚀
