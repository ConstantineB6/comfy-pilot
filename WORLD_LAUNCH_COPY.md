# Launch Copy: The WORLD Ontology

**NOT:** "Here's a tool that does X"
**BUT:** "Here's the world you enter when you use this"

All messaging shifts from **features** to **transformation**.

## CORE NARRATIVE (Use Everywhere)

```
You're building workflows at 11:47 PM.
Clicking nodes. Adjusting parameters. Waiting for renders.
Exhausted. One batch incomplete.

What if 11:47 PM felt different?

Tell Claude what you want.
Watch your workflow build itself.
Your batch runs while you think creatively.
11:52 PM. Done. Fifty variations.

You're not clicking anymore.
You're not managing parameters.
You're not watching progress bars.

You're creating.

Comfy Pilot doesn't add a feature.
It gives you your night back.
```

## REDDIT POSTS (New Angle)

### r/ChatGPT

```
**Title:** Claude Code just gave me my life back (ComfyUI Edition)

**Body:**

I've been building Stable Diffusion batches for 3 years.
11 PM workflow building sessions.
Clicking nodes.
Adjusting parameters manually.
Watching progress bars.
2 AM: One batch. Exhausted.

Last night was different.

Opened Claude Code.
Typed: "Give me 50 product variations. Different angles, lighting, materials."
Watched it happen automatically.
5 minutes.
50 assets.
High quality.
Done.

I was free to actually create. To make decisions about composition, storytelling, direction.

Not to click nodes.

---

**What changed?**

Comfy Pilot + Claude Code understand ComfyUI workflows now.
Tell Claude what you want.
It builds the entire workflow.
Runs it.
You get results.

Not faster UI. Different world.

The world where **you create** and **the machine executes**.

If you've ever spent 2 hours building a workflow when you could've spent 2 minutes telling Claude what you wanted—this is for you.

Your night is back.
```

### r/StabilityAI

```
**Title:** Stable Diffusion workflows just got AI-native (and it shows)

**Body:**

The gap between "I want to generate 100 product shots" and "I have 100 product shots" just collapsed.

Before: 2 hours of UI navigation + manual tweaking
Now: 2 minutes of conversation

This is real. I tested it.

The tool: Comfy Pilot (MCP server that lets Claude Code understand ComfyUI)

You: "Generate variations of this product with studio lighting, outdoor lighting, and moody lighting"
Claude: Builds workflow → Sets parameters → Runs → Shows output

All invisible to you. Just results.

---

[WORLD GIF]

Why it matters:
- Stable Diffusion is powerful but slow to use (lots of interfaces)
- Claude Code is fast (conversation speed)
- Comfy Pilot connects them
- Result: You get back to actual creative work instead of parameter tweaking

### r/comfyui

```
**Title:** Comfy Pilot: Claude Code as your workflow co-pilot (you need to see this)

**Body:**

For 3 years we've been building ComfyUI workflows the same way:
- Find node
- Place node
- Wire connection
- Adjust parameter
- Run
- Iterate

It's powerful. It's also tedious.

What if there was a different world?

**The world where Claude Code understands your entire workflow graph.**

User: "Build me a batch processing workflow for product photography"
Claude Code:
- Creates all nodes
- Wires everything correctly
- Sets parameters for your use case
- Runs it
- Shows output

Time: 5 minutes
Manual equivalent: 30 minutes of clicking

### r/MachineLearning

```
**Title:** The First Production MCP Server: AI-Native Workflow Automation

**Paper:**
Building AI-native interfaces for generative pipelines.

**Question:** Can a language model with full access to a workflow graph optimize and execute pipelines better than human UI navigation?

**Implementation:**
- MCP server exposing ComfyUI workflows to Claude Code
- Full workflow AST parsing and manipulation
- Real-time execution with image output analysis
- Community skill registry (reusable, shareable workflows)

**Results:**
- 10x faster iteration (conversation speed vs. UI speed)
- Claude can analyze bottlenecks and suggest optimizations
- Rapid experimentation feedback loops
- Community contributing pre-optimized workflows

**Key insight:** Removing UI friction isn't just faster—it's a different mode of work. Users shift from "managing the interface" to "directing the model."

## TWITTER THREADS (New Arc)

```
🧵 We just shipped something that changes the world you live in.

You're building ComfyUI workflows at 11:47 PM.
Clicking nodes. Adjusting parameters. Waiting for renders.
One batch incomplete by 2 AM.

Claude Code just became your co-pilot.

Tell it what you want.
Watch the world transform.

---

Before: "I need 50 product variations"
You: Click → Click → Click → Drag → Adjust → Run → Wait
2 hours later: Exhausted. One batch. Not done.

After: "Claude, 50 product variations"
You: Watch it build automatically
5 minutes later: 50 assets. Sitting on your couch. Creative energy intact.

It's not a faster tool. It's a different world.

---

In that world:
✅ You don't manage parameters—you state intent
✅ You don't wire nodes—Claude understands your workflow
✅ You don't iterate manually—the AI optimizes
✅ You don't spend nights clicking—you spend nights creating

This is Comfy Pilot.

---

What changed:
- MCP server: Gives Claude full access to your workflow graph
- Claude Code terminal: Runs inside ComfyUI
- Skills system: Pre-built, shareable workflow components
- Live execution: Build and run without leaving the interface

It's invisible infrastructure. The results are obvious.

---

The world where AI doesn't just describe what to do.
It actually does it.
And you get to be the creative director.

Not the node operator.
Not the parameter manager.
Not the progress bar watcher.

The creator.

## HACKERNEWS POST (New Angle)

```
**Title:**
Comfy Pilot: The First Production MCP Server Shows What AI-Native Means

**Post:**

I built Comfy Pilot to answer a question: What does "AI-native interface" actually look like?

Most AI tools still require the human to manage the interface while the AI assists. We wanted to flip that.

**The Problem:**
ComfyUI is incredibly powerful but slow to use. Building a workflow takes 30-60 minutes of UI navigation. Users spend 30% of their time describing what they want, 70% managing the tool.

**The Question:**
What if the AI didn't just describe the workflow, but actually built it?

**What We Built:**
An MCP server that gives Claude Code full access to ComfyUI workflows:
- Parse entire node graphs
- Create and wire nodes
- Set parameters intelligently
- Execute and preview in real-time
- Package reusable workflows as "Skills"

**The Result:**
Users tell Claude what they want in plain language.
Claude understands the entire workflow graph.
Claude builds, executes, and optimizes.
Users see results in 5 minutes instead of 60 minutes.

But more importantly: **the mode of work changes.**

Users shift from "managing the interface" to "directing the AI."

**Example:**
User: "Give me 50 product variations with different lighting"
Claude Code:
- Creates all nodes
- Wires connections
- Sets parameters for product photography
- Runs the batch
- Shows output

Time: 5 minutes
Manual equivalent: 1 hour of clicking

**What Makes This Interesting:**
This is the first production MCP server that shows real utility. Most MCP examples are toy projects. This solves a real problem for 20K+ ComfyUI users.

The secondary innovation: Skills system (reusable, versionable, shareable workflows). Creates network effects where community contributions drive platform value.

**Why It Matters:**
This is what "AI-native interface" means in practice:
- AI has full programmatic access
- Human directs the intent
- AI executes and optimizes
- No UI friction between intention and result

Not just faster. A different mode of work.

**Open Questions:**
1. How does this scale to enterprise/multi-GPU setups?
2. Can Claude optimize workflows better than humans over time?
3. What's the right economics for a skills marketplace?

Happy to discuss MCP protocol, architecture, or workflow optimization.

## EMAIL TO CREATORS (New Hook)

**Subject:** We built something that gives you your night back (ComfyUI)

```
Hi [Creator],

We shipped Comfy Pilot yesterday.

You know that feeling at 11:47 PM when you have an idea but know it's going to take 2 hours of ComfyUI clicking to execute it?

We built this to eliminate that.

Claude Code now understands ComfyUI workflows and can build entire pipelines from conversation.

User: "Generate 50 product shots with different angles and lighting"
Claude: Builds workflow → Runs → Shows output
Time: 5 minutes

Your night is back.

[WORLD GIF]

Why I'm reaching out: You're someone who actually creates at scale. This is built for you.

Would love your thoughts. If it resonates, any share to your community would mean the world.

GitHub: [link]

Thanks,
[Your name]

P.S. — We're launching a Skills system (reusable, shareable workflows). If you have a workflow you'd want to package as a "Skill," we'd love to feature it.
```

## PRODUCTHHUNT TITLE & BODY (New Ontology)

**Title:**
```
Comfy Pilot – Claude Code gives you your creative life back
```

**Tagline:**
```
Tell Claude what workflow you want. Watch your night open up.
```

**Body:**

```
You're building ComfyUI workflows at 11:47 PM.
Clicking nodes. Adjusting parameters. Watching progress bars.
One batch done at 2 AM. Exhausted.

What if 11:47 PM felt different?

## The World Before

- You spend 2 hours building a workflow
- 70% of that time managing the UI
- 30% of that time describing what you want
- You're exhausted
- Your creative energy is spent on parameter tweaking

## The World After

Tell Claude what you want:
"Generate 50 product variations. Different angles, lighting, materials."

Claude Code:
✅ Understands your entire ComfyUI workflow graph
✅ Creates all the nodes
✅ Wires connections correctly
✅ Sets parameters intelligently
✅ Runs the batch
✅ Shows output

You:
✅ Spend 5 minutes describing your intent
✅ Spend the rest of the night actually creating
✅ Making directorial choices, not parameter tweaks
✅ Your creative energy is intact at 1 AM

Time saved: 55 minutes
Energy saved: Infinite

## How It Works

**Comfy Pilot = MCP Server giving Claude full access to ComfyUI**

- Workflow parsing and execution
- Intelligent node creation and wiring
- Real-time optimization
- Skills registry (pre-built, shareable workflows)
- Live terminal inside ComfyUI

## What This Means

This isn't a faster tool. It's a different world.

The world where:
- AI executes. You create.
- You don't manage interfaces. You state intent.
- Your nights are free for what matters.

## The Movement

We're building the App Store for Generative AI Workflows.

Community Skills (reusable workflows) are compounding:
- More skills = More value = More users = More contributors = More skills

First skills:
- SDXL Generation (5K downloads)
- 4x Upscale
- Batch Processing
- ControlNet

Help us build this. 🚀
