## THE NARRATIVE THESIS

This GIF doesn't sell Comfy Pilot.
It sells **the world Comfy Pilot creates.**

Before watching: "I'm tired of clicking ComfyUI"
After watching: "I want that world. I want my time back. I want to create again."

The product is invisible. The transformation is visible.

**This is what changes the narrative from "tool" to "liberation."**
